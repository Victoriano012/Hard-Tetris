# Hard-Tetris

This repository is a project from my degree's first year. The folder "Statement" has the statement of the project that was given to us.

In short terms, we had to code everything related with a game really similar to the popular tetris, with the difference that the player can place the pieces everywhere in the board (no gravity) and the shape of the board is not the same in all games.

My implementation of the gameboard and the commands to be used to play can be found on "gameboard.py".
And the implementation of a player of the game can be found on "myplayer.py", it has to methods (or modes), simple which follows a really easy strategy, and expert which has a much more perfected strategy.

I really enjoyed doing this project, specially doing the expert mode of the player, which was the most creative part and where I could spend more hours enhancing it.
